Librarys dependencies visualization

If you want to see a visual dependency relation graph, need to install graphviz.

For exampele if you can use apt (ex; ubuntu) ;

> sudo apt-get install graphviz

So you have installed, can generate the image file;

> dot -Tpng dependency.dot -o dependency.png

If you use Ubuntu, you can view the image file by 'eog';

> eog dependency.png

Workaround of libtool's bug

The gcc's flag '-static-libgcc' is ignored in building a DLL ( or may be a shared library too ),
even though it set the flag to LDFLAGS.

It seems a long standig bug; https://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2009-02/msg00231.html

So in these build-*.sh set the above flag to variable CC at configure options as a workaround of the bug,
instead of setting into the LDFLAGS.
